"""
In this implementation we are solving one major problem related to the 
previous version (which is referred to as MPSGNN_Model_old, please check git history),
which is that, when we used the full x_dict[nodetype]
tensors without checking which nodes were actually connected by the 
relation. This means we were doing message passing over all nodes, 
including nodes that are completely disconnected from the current relation.

The solution should be that instead considering all the dst e src nodes
for the message passing, we focus only on the ones for which we have at
leat an edge between src to dst.

In other words, this code:
def forward(self, x_dict, edge_index_dict):
    #edge_type_dict is the list of edge types
    #edge_index_dict contains for each edge_type the edges
    h_dict = x_dict.copy()
    for i, (src, rel, dst) in enumerate(reversed(self.metapath)): #reversed
        conv_idx = len(self.metapath) - 1 - i
        edge_index = edge_index_dict[(src, rel, dst)]
        #only the one of the relation specified
        h_dst = self.convs[conv_idx](
            x=h_dict[dst],
            h=h_dict[dst],
            edge_index=edge_index
        )
        h_dict[dst] = F.relu(h_dst)
    start_type = self.metapath[0][0]
    return self.out_proj(h_dict[start_type])

was wrong because simply considered x=h_dict[dst], without exclude all the 
dst nodes that are not reached from src, adding them to the aggregation phase.

A solution could be to exclude all the nodes that are not reached from the 
relation, but this would generate a new problem to be managed:
Given edge_index = [[3, 4, 5], [6, 2, 3]], this means there's an edge from
x_dict["races"][3] to x_dict["drivers"][6], and so on. Suppose 
x_dict["races"] originally has shape [128, D] and x_dict["drivers"]
is [200, D]. If you do x_dict["races"] = x_dict["races"][[3,4,5]], then 
x_dict["races"] now has shape [3, D] where index 0 corresponds to global
node 3, index 1 to 4, and index 2 to 5. But edge_index still uses global
indices [3, 4, 5], so when your GNN tries to index x[3], it will go out
of bounds, because x only has indices [0,1,2] now. So after filtering nodes,
you must remap edge_index to the new local indices. If global â†’ local is 
{3:0, 4:1, 5:2}, then remap edge_index[0] = [0,1,2].

This is my version of meta path model, if you encounter any problem, or mistake please 
do not hesitate to reach me out! :)



Main differences with respect to the original paper work:
1. HeteroEncoder
2. TemporalHeteroEncoder->the original paper was not designed for temporal graphs
3. Self attention between metapaths
4. MetapathGNN only consider nodes that are considered for a certain path. This 
   not only make sense logically: when considering a certain path we should not
   change the node embeddings of nodes that are of the type "src", but never 
   connected through the path to "dst"; but it also did show improvement in the 
   performance. The original paper did not discuss about this point, but in the 
   official documentation on GitHub we did not find this check.
5. Interpret_attention, which is possible only thanks to point 3, is implemented 
   above the model to have a fully transparent model.
6. Normalization in MetaPathGNNLayer.forward
